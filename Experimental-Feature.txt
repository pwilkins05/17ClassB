Fore score and seven years ago our forfathers began a group. 
Hensforth the group of four became known for their triumph in the face of adversity and their four giant cocks. 
Their four fighting cocks. Adventures in fourty nights of brutish conquest around each of the corners known to this earth.
Their four champion fowl asking no forgiveness, forsaken of their mothers to become the forbearers of greatness. 

The plain and rounded corner of green hill, wavy grass and forest; The dark and dreary corner of old fortunes; 
The dangerous corner of foreboding cliff and forked river; And the formly and feroucious corner of transgender hen. 

Their tale is yet to be told but of one thing we can all be sure. 
Their fortune and fame came with narry a tale we wont embellish to the fullest. 
And who could blame us?
